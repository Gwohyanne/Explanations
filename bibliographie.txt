## A Proof-Producing CSP Solver, Michael Veksler and Ofer Strichman
Solver which produces a machine-checkable proof in case the input is unsatisfiable.

## Propagation via Lazy Clause Generation, Olga Ohrimenko, Peter J. Stuckey and Michael Codish
Mimic a finite domain propagation engine by converting propagators in lazy clause generators for a SAT solver. Variables are modelled dually: in the propagator and in the solver: this solution appears to be faster than other techniques.

## A framework for step-wise explaining how to solve constraint satisfaction problems,  Bart Bogaerts, Emilio Gamba and Tias Guns
Explaining inferences steps taken during a problem resolution in a way that is understandable for a person: favours simple explanations.

## Conflict analysis in CP solving: Explanation generation from constraint generation, Arthur Gonthier, Charlotte Truchet and Charles Prudhomme
Method to automatically generate explanation rules for a constraint decomposition.

## Learning general constraints in CSP, Michael Veksler and Ofer Strichman
New learning scheme for CSP solvers, which traverses backwards a conflict graph to create a conflict constraint.
